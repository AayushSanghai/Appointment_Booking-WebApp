# Webapp for booking an appointment

In this full-stack project, we will learn how to develop a simple full-stack web application that is a basic Banking Appointment Application using React, Spring Boot, RestAPI and SQL Database.

The back-end server uses Spring Boot with Spring Web MVC for REST APIs and Spring Data JPA for interacting with the MySQL database. The Front-end side is made with React, React Router, Axios & Bootstrap.

## Objective

I have build a full stack web app for booking an appointment at a local bank to carry out various activities with CRUD features viz :
- Create Customer
- Book An Appointment to a nearest branch
- List all the Upcoming appointments for a user
- Delete an appointment
- Update an existing appointment

Some basic overview of the technologies used:

- Spring Boot : Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". I take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration. I also used Spring Boot to develop REST web services and micro services.

- React JS : It is a JavaScript library created by Facebook and it used to build user interface for the front end.
